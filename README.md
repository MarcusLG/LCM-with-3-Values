# LCM-with-3-Values
Determining the 3rd value given the LCM for a group of 3 numbers
The programme starts with determining the listof prime numbers from 0-1000, which sets the intrinsic limit on the LCM can be accepted. 
Using the max(a,b) function, the maximum power for each prime factor is determined, from which the fulfillment for the power of the smallest 3rd number can be computed.

-v1.1 Added with finding out all the possible multiples
To compute the possible value of Num 3, a separate pair.py library is supplimented, which uses carrying number to determine all the possible combinations.
